            <p> and aspiring Fullstack Developer driven by a passion for building innovative, user-friendly applications. My journey is rooted in a commitment to mastering both technical and design skills to create digital solutions that captivate users and solve real-world challenges.
                Currently, I am pursuing software development and JavaScript engineering with CodeSpace Academy and software engineering through HyperionDev, where I am gaining hands-on experience in building scalable and efficient applications. Starting in January, I will expand my expertise further by enrolling in a one-year Fullstack Software Engineering program with Melsoft Academy, a UI/UX diploma through the UX Design Institute, and a Bachelor of Science in Software Development through IU University of Applied Sciences.
                By integrating UI/UX principles into my fullstack development journey, I aim to create engaging and impactful applications that prioritize user experience and seamless functionality. I am particularly excited about the prospect of blending technical precision with creative design to deliver solutions that leave a lasting impression.
                With this robust educational foundation and a drive for continuous learning, I am eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology and bring innovative ideas to life.</p>
